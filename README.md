## Scripts to start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

...or if you wanna check my page directly in the browser without needing to run the scripts use the link below:
